# Magical Arena Game

This project implements a simple text-based game called "Magical Arena" in Java. In this game, two players battle each other in an arena until one of them loses all their health.


## Instructions for Development

1. **Java Project Setup**: Set up a Java project in your preferred IDE (I am working in SpringBoot).
   
2. **Implement Game Logic**:
   - Create a Java class named `MagicalArena`.
   - Implement the game logic within this class, including player attributes, dice rolling, and the main game loop.
   - Ensure to commit your changes regularly with descriptive commit messages.

3. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Create a JUnit test class named `MagicalArenaTests`.
   - Write test cases to validate the behavior of the `MagicalArena` class methods.
   - Run the tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

4. **Commit Changes**: Make frequent commits to track your progress and ensure version control. Use meaningful commit messages to describe the changes made.

5. **Review Code**: Review your code to ensure readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

6. **Run Tests**: Regularly run the unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.


## Project Structure

- `MagicalArena.java`: This class contains the main logic for the Magical Arena game. It handles player attributes, dice rolling, and game flow.
- `MagicalArenaTests.java`: This JUnit test class contains test cases to verify the functionality of the `MagicalArena` class.
